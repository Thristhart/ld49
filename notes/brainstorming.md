# Questions

## Mechanical

-   What is an Action? (Damage/Healing, Buffs/Debuffs: [], Wait Time, Targeting)
    -   Are there Damage Types?
    -   Or fuck, are there positions here? (Nah)
    -   What is a combo? Status Effects with triggers.
    -   What is a round? No real thing here?
        -   What is a turn order? A dynamic list that updates after every turn, shifting the last player down based on their speed and the action chosen.
    -   What limits ability usage? (Mana? PP? Turn-based Cooldowns?) (Fuck Mana)
-   Stats
    -   Health
    -   SPD = Acc + Eva + Initiative
    -   STR = Melee Damage + Melee CD + Melee Resistance
    -   PRE(Precision) = ACC + Ranged Damage + Status Effectiveness increase.
    -   UNP(Unpredictability) = Instability Table Bonus + Eva + Cooldown Reduction + Instability Gain Increase
    -   SRD(Sturdiness) = Instability Gain Reduction + Damage Reduction + Resistance to Debuffs
    -   UTB(Untiltability) (CHL(Chill)) = Instability Table Roll Manipulation + Instability Effect Multiplier + Status Effect Duration Reduction (Pos + Neg) (Multiplies duration by a percentage and then floors it)
