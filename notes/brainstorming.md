    -   Are there Damage Types?
    -   Or fuck, are there positions here? (Nah)
    -   What is a combo? Status Effects with triggers.
    -   What is a round? No real thing here?
        -   What is a turn order? A dynamic list that updates after every turn, shifting the last player down based on their speed and the action chosen.

    -   Player Stats:
        -   SPD = Acc + Eva + Cooldown Reduction + Initial Initiative
        -   STR = Melee Damage + Melee CD + Melee Resistance
        -   PRE(Precision) = ACC + Ranged Damage + Status Effectiveness increase.
        -   UNP(Unpredictability) = Instability Table Bonus + Eva + Cooldown Reduction + Instability Gain Increase
